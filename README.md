# SAP NetWeaver on Azure

Contoso Group is a US-based telecommunications company with worldwide operations serving almost 150 million mobile subscribers. The company is looking to optimize its IT environment and considering moving some of its on-premises SAP workloads to Azure.

The company's CIO wants to significantly improve times it takes to provision development and test SAP environments. At the same time, he stresses the importance of minimizing their cost. He also points out the criticality of the SAP production workloads and the need of protecting them against unplanned downtime.

Contoso CIO and the company CFO, along with Business Development Manager (BDM), Director of SAP Business Analysts, and Director of SAP Operations are all open to taking advantage of Azure as a platform and want their respective teams to be able to leverage the scalability and resiliency provided by the cloud platform.

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop you will learn to deploy and configure SAP on Azure infrastructure and SAP NetWeaver deployment running on Azure infrastructure, including SAP NetWeaver ASCS and SAP NetWeaver database servers. Key takeaways are the Azure infrastructure solution components and the way they are put together to run SAP applications as well as the Solution architecture references.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to design and deploy SAP running on Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) components and understand proper configuration of SAP NetWeaver ASCS, database and application servers in Azure.

### Whiteboard design session 

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn how to deploy SAP on Azure infrastructure components as well as perform an SAP on Azure need assessment, take part in an SAP on Azure architecture design discussion, and respond to an RFI/RFP for SAP on Cloud opportunity.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to architect for SAP running on Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) components and understand proper configuration of SAP NetWeaver ASCS, database and application servers in Azure.

### Hands-on lab 

In this hands-on lab you will setup and configure SAP NetWeaver by using a combination of Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) components. You will setup identity management by using Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS), file sharing by using Azure Files service, NetWeaver application and database tiers by using Azure virtual machines (VMs) and integrate them with Active Directory. You will then setup high-availability for SAP ASCS components hosted on Azure VMs by configuring failover clustering. Finally, you will configure the database tier with Always-On Availability Groups and configure the NetWeaver application servers for redundancy.

As you step through the hands-on-lab, you will learn how to optimize deployment of SAP on Azure, including configuration of SAP NetWeaver ASCS servers, SAP NetWeaver database servers, and SAP NetWeaver Application servers.
