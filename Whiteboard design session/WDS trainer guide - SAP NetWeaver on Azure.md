# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

-   Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

-   Stimulates the participant's thinking.

-   Involves the participant in the learning process.

-   Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

-   Ensures individual participant accountability.

-   Ties it all together for the participant.

-   Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

-   Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

-   Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

-   Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow 

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

-   Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

-   Current customer infrastructure and architecture

-   Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

-   Determine your target customer audience.

-   Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

-   Design and diagram your solution.

-   Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

-   Present solution

-   Respond to customer objections

-   Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

-   Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

-   Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

-   Become familiar with all key points and activities.

-   Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

-   Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

-   Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

-   **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

-   **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

-   **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

### Customer situation

Contoso Group is a US-based telecommunications company with headquarters in NY.  

Contoso Group maintains on-premises deployments of SAP Business Suite on Windows Server 2008 R2 with a SQL Server 2008 R2 in its US-based data center.

The IT organization finds it challenging to expand the SAP landscape to accommodate growing number of SAP-related business requests. This is related to the time and resources required to move through development and testing phases and implement new business processes into production. In addition, IT finds it difficult to adjust the size of the production environment in order to accommodate varying level of workloads. IT is also concerned about lack of high availability and disaster recovery capabilities in the existing deployment. The estimates of providing such capabilities for production workloads exceed the budget allocated for this purpose by far.

As the result, agility of the organization is hampered by capital expenditures and the time necessary to acquire and provision project-related SAP development and testing environments. Representatives of central IT management, including the company CIO Andrew Cross and its VP of IT Operations are concerned about managing test/dev infrastructure costs. There are also concerns regarding aging data center and hardware. Business Development Manager (BDM) and the company CFO would like to lower TCO for the SAP landscape, including the production ECC environment. 

Contoso Leadership and Planning Groups introduced a mandate to drastically reduce server and storage hardware in their own datacenters to minimize IT related costs. Contoso has already a number of their non-SAP systems migrated to Azure. The leadership asked Contoso IT to look into the possibility to migrate its existing SAP Business Suite to cloud. 

Contoso IT decided to leverage its knowledge of the Microsoft cloud platform and existing ExpressRoute connectivity to host its SAP landscape in Azure. Considering that Contoso finance and supply chain teams strongly rely on SAP Business Suite, the systems should be highly available, and their performance must be predictable and consistent.  In addition, the management team wants to leverage disaster recovery capabilities offered by Azure in order to ensure resiliency in case the primary region hosting the new deployment becomes unavailable. 

Before migrating the production environment, Contoso wants to test its new deployment approach by provisioning development, and UAT environments in Azure.

**Existing Contoso SAP environment**

Contoso Group has an existing on-premises deployment of SAP ECC (SAP ERP Central Component) 6.0 on Windows Server 2008 R2 with a SQL Server 2008 R2 database in its US-based data center near New York City. The deployment consists of the development, test, quality assurance, and production systems. 

The production app tier consists of three physical servers, each with 8 CPU cores and 32GB RAM. The production database tier is hosted on a single physical server with the same hardware configuration. The average performance of the application tier and the database tier is about 30,000 SAPS and 15,000 SAPS, respectively. The production SAP database workload generates about 20,000 IOPS. The current production DB size is 750GB. According to the estimates of the Contoso SAP team, the database is bound to grow to about 1TB in the next few years. In case of a disaster affecting the production instance, the business expects the RPO and RTO of 15 minutes and 2 hours, respectively. 

![A Customer environment diagram has a box with Test/Dev, Production, SAN storage, Tape devices, End users, and Legacy systems. A callout with a list of technical requirements points to Production. An arrow labeled Azure Migration points from the box to to a cloud with Dev/Test, DR and Production on Azure. Questions on the bottom are Compute/storage sizing, High availability and DR, and Cloud migration.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image2.png)

**Customer objectives**

As Andrew Cross, the company's CIO wants to significantly improve times it takes to provision development and test SAP environments. At the same time, he stresses the importance of minimizing their cost. He also points out the criticality of the SAP production workloads and the need of protecting them against unplanned downtime. As he stated, "The existing on-premises SAP development and test environments no longer meet the agility required by the fast pace of changes in our business. In addition, our operational dependencies on SAP applications force us to seek reasonably priced availability and disaster recovery capabilities for our production SAP deployments."

Contoso CIO and the company CFO, along with Business Development Manager (BDM), Director of SAP Business Analysts, and Director of SAP Operations are all open to taking advantage of Azure as a platform and want their respective teams to be able to leverage the scalability and resiliency provided by the cloud platform.

### Customer needs 

-   Reduce time to deploy new business processes to have competitive customer offers.

-   Reduce time required to provision development and test environments.

-   Lower costs incurred by the development, test, and production environments.

-   Identify an estimated monthly infrastructure cost for operating your solution.

### Technical requirements

-   SAP ERP/ECC 6.0 NetWeaver is the application tier.

-   SQL Server is the data tier.

-   Application tier on the production system requires total of 30,000 SAPS.

-   Database tier on the production system requires total of 15,000 SAPS.

-   Database tier on the production system needs 20,000 IOPS.

-   The size of database files on the production system is 750GB, with the expected growth to 1TB.

-   RPO=15 min, RTO=6 hours

-   SLA : Availability 99.9%, RPO=15min, RTO = 2hr

### Customer objections 

-   If I have already paid for my hardware to run my dev/test environment, how am I getting any cost savings by moving it to Azure? How much more is your cloud solution costing me?

-   What if I need my cloud resources to access on-premises resources?

-   Will Azure meet our security and compliance requirements?

-   Do I have to pay for resources when they are stopped?

-   For my dev environment, can I automate stopping VMs during idle times?

### Key design considerations

1.  Two primary HA/DR options

    -   HA in an Availability Set and DR across regions (DR replica can coexist with QA in the second region)

        This option represents the traditional design, which relies on well-established concept of availability sets and leverages a pair of Azure regions in the same geography. An Azure Availability Set is a logical grouping capability that helps ensure that the VM resources that you place within the Availability Set are failure-isolated from each other when they are deployed within an Azure datacenter. Azure ensures that the VMs you place within an Availability Set run across multiple physical servers, compute racks, storage units, and network switches. This configuration is referred to as placements in different update and fault domains. These placements usually are within an Azure datacenter. Assuming that power source and network issues would affect the datacenter that you are deploying, all your capacity in one Azure region would be affected. 

        Note that it is important to consider high availability and disaster recovery provisions separately for each component of this design:

        -   HANA Database layer - both high availability and disaster recovery is implemented by using HANA System Replication (synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the option). In case of synchronous replication, the high availability functionality relies additionally on Linux-based Pacemaker clustering.

        -   SAP Central Services (ASCS) layer - high availability is implemented by using operating system-level clustering (either Windows Server Failover Clustering or Linux-based Pacemaker clustering, depending on the underlying operating system). Disaster recovery relies across Azure regions on Azure Site Recovery, which replicates virtual disks of cluster members to the secondary site. Azure Site Recovery is also used to orchestrate failover between sites.

        -   SAP file share layer - high availability of the sapmnt share is implemented by using either Windows-based file share (based on Windows Storage Spaces Direct cluster hosting Scale-Out File Server) or Linux-based NFS mount (based on Azure NetApp Files or Linux Distributed Replicated Block Device). Disaster recovery relies on Azure Site Recovery, which replicates the file sharing infrastructure to the secondary site. When using Azure NetApp Files NFS-based approach, NetApp offers a SaaS based solution called NetApp Cloud Sync. You can use any file based-copy tool (such as rsync) to replicate data to the secondary site (including file or folder permissions).      

        -   SAP Application Server layer - high availability is implemented by simply deploying multiple application servers. Disaster recovery across Azure regions relies on Azure Site Recovery, which replicates virtual disks of application servers to the secondary site. Azure Site Recovery is also used to orchestrate failover between sites.

        ![A diagram representing the HA in an Availability Set and DR across regions design option.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image17.png)

    -   HA/DR across Availability Zones

        This option represents a different design that takes advantage of availability zones, representing separate, physically isolated data centers within the same region. The placement of datacenters that represent Azure Availability Zones constitutes a compromise between delivering acceptable network latency to services deployed in different zones, and a distance between datacenters. The distance matters because even though majority of destructive events are not likely to affect the infrastructure of all Availability Zones in the same region, history offers examples of larger scale disasters that could have such impact. To account for such occurrences, organizations might have the minimum distance requirement between the location of their production and disaster recovery sites. For most Azure customers, the minimum distance definition necessitates the use of two or more Azure regions.

        Note that it is important to consider high availability and disaster recovery provisions separately for each component of this design. In this case, the highly available production components are distributed across Availability Zone 1 and Availability Zone 2:

        -   HANA Database layer is hosted by a Linux Pacemaker cluster containing an active VM instance residing in Availability Zone 1 and standby VM instance residing in Availability Zone 2, with HANA Synchronous replication between nodes of the cluster. Clustering is implemented by using Pacemaker.

        -   ASCS layer hosted by a Windows cluster contains an active VM instance residing in Availability Zone 1 and a standby VM instance residing in Availability Zone 2. 

        -   SAP file share layer on Windows cluster contains a one VM node residing in Availability Zone 1 and another VM node residing in Availability Zone 2. 

        -   SAP Application Server layer consists of a PAS server VM in Availability Zone 1 and AAS in Availability Zone 2. Clustering is not used in this case since high availability is built-into the PAS and AAS functionality.  

        ![A diagram representing the HA/DR across Availability Zones design option.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image18.png)

    In addition, when choosing the DR approach for your solutions, consider:

    -   Requirements, which can be divided into two categories:

        -   Business requirements:

            -   Minimum data loss in case of a disaster

            -   Failover completed within hours (including SAP application layer)

            -   Clear failover process

            -   Failover process is abstracted from users and subsystems

            -   Minimum cost

        -   IT requirements:

            -   Production environment is virtualized, on bare metal, or in the cloud

            -   Minimum overhead on production environment (including networking)

            -   No need for traditional SAN/tape backup solutions

    -   Disaster recovery mechanism for each of the three primary components:

        -   Database replication (e.g. SQL Server AlwaysOn)

        -   File replication (e.g. file copy)

        -   VM replication (Azure Site Recovery)

        ![DR solutions for SAP on Azure.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image19.png)

1.  Azure VM compute & storage sizing principles for SAP workloads

    -   Start by identifying customer requirements, including: 

        -   Type of environment: production, or non-production (dev and test)

        -   SAPS required for the SAP application and database tiers

        -   IOPS and storage throughput required for the database tier

        -   System activity period (consider Azure automation to stop non-production VMs during idle times)

    -   Use Premium storage for SAP databases (both database files and log files).

    -   SAP application servers are usually deployed on Standard storage, but can be deployed on small Premium storage disks (P4, P6) if using a single server in order to benefit from single instance SLA.

    -   For database servers, use Windows storage spaces or LINUX volume managers to stripe disks and aggregate IOPS, throughput and storage capacity

    -   Next, use select a compute SKU based on SAPS required for database tier

    -   Finally, select compute SKUs based on SAPS required for application tier

    In general, there are two ways to determine the proper size of SAP systems to be implemented in Azure – by using reference sizing or by employing SAP Quick Sizer.

    For existing on-premises systems, you should reference system configuration and resource utilization data.  The system utilization information is collected by the SAP OS Collector and can be reported via transaction OS07N as well as the Early Watch Report.  Similar information can be retrieved by leveraging any system performance and statistics gathering tools.

    The SAP EarlyWatch Alert is a diagnostic service that delivers monitoring of both SAP and non-SAP systems in the SAP Solution Manager. The service captures variety of performance-related data, including, for example, general component status, system configuration, average response times, system load, critical error messages and process interruptions. 

    For new systems, you should use SAP quick sizer, which can be accessed at https://service.sap.com/quicksizer. Note that access to it requires an Online Service System account. Online Service System (or, in short, OSS) is used to provide online access to SAP users and partners to SAP applications and data
Quick Sizer offers two independent sizing approaches: user-based and throughput-based. For smaller environments, the user-based sizing approach might be sufficient. Business requirements are determined by the number of users performing business specific tasks. Users are grouped per business task according to their estimated usage activity. For larger and more complex environments, it is recommended to use throughput-based sizing. This takes into account not only the number of users performing business specific tasks but also an information about business processes and business objects.

    For the purpose of this design session, you will assume that the relevant sizing data has already been collected. In order to identify the configuration of our Azure-based deployment, you will perform three tasks:

    -   Choose VM type of SAP ASCS, application, and database layers based on the provided SAPS requirements

    -   Choose storage type and the number of disks for SAP database layer based on the provided IOPS, throughput, and latency requirements

    -   Identify the number of VMs for SAP ASCS, application, and database layers based on the provided resiliency requirements

    ![A table of customer requirements and sizing for Azure has rows labeled SOFS, ASCS, Application, and Database. Customer requirement columns are SAPS needed, IOPS needed, and Current DB Volume. Nine sizing for Azure columns include items such as Azure VM type, number of vms and whether they are active, SAPS provided, Database Files Premium Storage SKU and number of disks, IOPS for Database Files provided, Storage size allocated for DB files, Database Log Premium Storage SKU and number of disks, and Latency for Log. The Sizing for Azure columns have question marks.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image13.png "How to size SAP on Azure VMs")

    In order to identify the VM types, you will use the information provided in the following table:

    ![A table containing the listing of performance characteristics of SAP-certified Azure VM sizes.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image14.png)

    In order to identify disks for SAP database layer, you will use the information provided in the following table:

    ![A table containing the listing of performance characteristics of Premium Storage disks.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image15.png)

    Premium Storage offers the following characteristics:

    -   Consistent low latency SSD with predictable throughput

    -   Intended for high-performance IO-intensive DB workloads

    -   Single digit ms latencies

    -   Supports up to 32 TB blob/disk size

    -   Stripe (to aggregate IOPS, throughput, and capacity) up to 64 disks for a total of 2,048 TB

    -   Disk performance is dependent on the disk size, with up to 20,000 IOPS per disk 

    -   Ensure to account for Azure VMs level IOPS limits

    -   Pay for what you provision (cost per GB differs by region)

1.  When designing the architecture of your solution, consider the following factors: 

    -   the choice of the Azure region(s)

    -   the hybrid connectivity method (ExpressRoute and/or Site to Site VPN)

    -   the choice of the virtual gateway SKUs

    -   the method of implementing high-availability of the database layer

    -   the method of implementing high-availability of the ASCS and application servers

    -   the role of Azure services in your solution

    -   the method of implementing disaster recovery in your solution

    ![A diagram of Subnet business suite, NetWeaver with HA and DR has two Azure regions. The first region includes a GW Subnet, subnet #1 - AP Prod, Subnet #2 - DB Prod, and subnet #3 - Mgmt. The second region has GW subnet, subnet #4  - AP DR, and subnet #5 - DB DR, and Subnet #6 Mgmt. Both regions are connected via ExpressRoute to a building icon. There are collouts referencing these components labeled, respectively, VPN/ExpressRoute Gateway SKU?, How to design highly available SQL Server VMs?, What other Azure services can be used? Domain controller and other VMs? ExpressRoute or/and S2S VPN?, and What are DR Solutions? ](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image16.png "How to build high availability across regions")

1.  Account for backup requirements by incorporating some or all of the following capabilities into your solution:

    -   Online backup of SQL Server databases, files and OS system state with minimum overhead

    -   Backup to Azure Blob Storage (Azure Backup Vault)

    -   Point-in-time restore

    -   Minimizing backup storage (via incremental backups)

    -   Centralized console for monitoring and alert capabilities

    ![Enterprise Backup Solutions for LOB applications/SAP on Azure](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image20.png "Enterprise Backup Solutions for LOB applications/SAP on Azure")

1.  When evaluating the cost of your solution: 

    -   Use Azure Pricing Calculator

    -   Consider best OS licensing option(s):

        -   It is common NOT to include Windows license costs because of Azure Hybrid Use Benefits

        -   Linux OS subscription costs can be based on Azure Marketplace

    -   Provide assumptions for ExpressRoute bandwidth

1.  To summarize, when designing your solution, account for the following requirements:

    -   problem statement and customer benefits

    -   secure and low latency network connectivity

    -   Windows-based application tier

    -   SQL Server-based database tier

    -   Specific sizing requirements (SAPS) for the application tier

    -   Specific sizing requirements (SAPS) for the database tier

    -   Specific IO requirements

    -   HA capabilities (as part of 3-tier deployment)

    -   Load-balanced front-end for the database tier

    -   Backup solution and storage for data retention

    -   Monitoring solution

    -   Security solution

    -   DR capabilities (with multi-region deployment)

    -   Monthly cost estimate

    -   Migration methodology

2.  What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?

**Design**

Directions: With all participants at your table, respond to the following questions on a flip chart:

*Architecting a multi-tier SAP solution*

Using the features of Azure and the requirements from the customer, design the application infrastructure and network for Contoso SAP deployment in Azure. Consider such factors as cost of ownership of entire SAP landscape as well as high availability and disaster recovery capabilities for the production environment.

![Benefits of migration to Azure. Three empty current state boxes point to three empty future state boxes.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image4.png)

Make sure that your design covers the following items:

*High-level architecture*

**Task:** Identifying the target Azure region(s) and the number of tiers.

-   Identify the optimal choices for Azure region(s) where the solution should be deployed.

-   Choose between the 2-tier and 3-tier architecture.

*Requirements Recap*

![A requirements table lists sixteen steps to produce a design.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image7.png)

*Architecting a multi-tier SAP solution*

The solution illustrates the benefits of migration to Microsoft Cloud. In the current state:

-   Contoso SAP is ECC on Windows/SQL 2008 R2 – EOS coming soon

-   Hardware is of fixed size, underutilized and oversized

-   Largest server is DB with 8-core, 32GB RAM and 2TB DB

-   There is no virtualization nor BI/Analytics solution identified

-   Customer is concerned about migration to cloud and to HANA

Migration to Microsoft Cloud offers a range of benefits: 

-   SAP application and platform that Contoso is running are fully certified for Azure

-   SAP can scale up/down/out/in any time and any way in Azure 

-   8-core Azure VM is just 80 cents per hour and largest VM is 32-core, 448GB RAM and 41k SAPS

-   Customer can have full virtualization, automation, standardization and BI/Analytics solutions in Azure

-   SAP standard SAP System Copy Tool can be used for migration to the cloud.

![Benefits of migration to Azure. Six current state boxes point to six future state boxes, representing the benefits of Microsoft Cloud Platform.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image21.png)

*Azure VM Design tips*

Use the following tips and key considerations to design Azure VM to run the most mission critical SAP with extra-large SAP database on Azure. 

-   Use certified Azure VM types, especially for Production (M Series VM are certified for both Any DB and HANA). 

-   Use Premium Storage instead of Standard for database and all I/O intensive VMs. 

-   Do not forget about storage space required to store backup. That said, in addition to extra local storage space to keep short-term backup, make sure to add cool storage or Azure Backup Vault if long-term backup retention is the requirement. 

-   Set up high availability and disaster recovery solutions. Note that database replication feature such as SQL Server Always On is more efficient and reliable than Azure Site Recovery for large database replication to provide nearly zero RPO. 

-   ExpressRoute is always recommended for SAP environment. This way a customer in Australia for example is running their entire SAP Business Suite with 5TB ECC database fully in Azure. 

*High-level architecture*

The preferred solution includes the Disaster Recovery environment, with US East 2 as the primary region and US West 2 as the secondary. The primary Azure region will host highly available ASCS components, implemented by using Windows Failover clustering. The highly available sapmnt share will leverage a Scale Out File Server (SOFS), hosted by two Azure VMs forming a Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) cluster (alternatively, you can use for this purpose a third party disk synchronization solution, such as SIOS DataKeeper). Access to ASCS components will be provided via an Azure  Internal Load Balancer. The database tier will consist of two highly available SQL Server instances implemented by using SQL Server AlwaysOn and exposed to the application tier via an Internal Load Balancer. We will also rely on SQL Server AlwaysOn to accommodate the disaster recovery requirement by replicating asynchronously content of the AlwaysOn Availability group to the other Azure region. To accomplish high availability on the application tier, we will deploy two Azure VMs hosting the Primary application server and an Additional Application Server. 
The second Azure region will host the third node of the SQL Server AlwaysOn cluster that, during normal business operations, can serve quality assurance, development, and test purposes. Note that, in an event of a disaster, we would need to provision the ASCS and SAP application servers in this region. This is accomplished by using Azure Site Recovery, which handles replication of Azure VM disk files as well as orchestration of failover and failback. 
The management subnet in both regions hosts infrastructure components, including Active Directory domain controllers and Azure Backup Server instances.
Hybrid connectivity is implemented via an ExpressRoute, with ExpressRoute Gateway Standard or High (with the throughput of 1Gbs or 2Gbps, respectively). 

![Screenshot of the complete solution diagram of Subnet business suite, NetWeaver with HA and DR has two Azure Datacenters - East US 2, and West US 2. East US 2 includes a GW Subnet, subnet #1 - AP Prod, and Subnet #2 - DB Prod. West US 2 has GW subnet, subnet #4  - AP DR, and subnet #5 - DB DR, and Subnet #6 management. An arrow points from East US 2 subnet 2 to West US 2 subnet 5. Both datacenters are connected via ExpressRoute to a building icon. Callouts listing copmponents of the solution point to GW subnet, Availability Set SAP ASCS on Subnet #1 - AP prod, Subnet #2 - DB prod, Subnet #3 Mgmt, Log Analytics and Backup, ExpressRoute, Subnet #4 - AP DR, Subnet #5 - DB DR, Subnet #6 Mgmt. GW subnet in both regions includes ExpresRoute Gateway. Subnet #1 - AP Prod subnet includes Availability Set SAP ASCS, Availability Set Scale Out File Server, and Availablity Set SAP AP. Subnet #2 - DB Prod includes two Microsoft SQL Server Azure VMs in the same availability set. Subnet #3 Mgmt includes Azure VMs hosting domain controller and Azure Backup Server (SCDPM). Subnet #4 - AP DR includes offline replicas of Availability Set SAP ASCS, Availability Set Scale Out File Server, and Availablity Set SAP AP. Subnet #5 - DB DR includes a single Azure VM hosting SQL Server AlwaysOn async replica. Subnet #6 Mgmt includes Azure VMs hosting domain controller and Azure Backup Server (SCDPM). Azure Datacenter East US 2 and Azure Datacenter West US 2 also include Storage, Automation, Backup, Log Analytics, Site Recovery, and Security Center. ](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image22.png)

*Sizing Compute and Storage*

To determine sizing of compute and storage of your solution, you start with the SAPS required for the application and database servers. According to customer’s requirements, the ASCS layer requires 30,000 SAPS. Considering that the application servers operate in the active/active configuration, you will need at minimum two E16sv3, which collectively provide 34,840 SAPS. For ASCS, which operates in the active/passive configuration, you can use a couple of smallest SAP certified Azure VM of Standard E2s_v3 size, each of which provides 2,178 SAPS. To account for the SAPS requirements for the database layer, the solution includes two Standard E16s_v3 Azure VMs. This is necessary since the database servers operate in the active/passive configuration, so we need to consider SAPS characteristics of individual servers (rather than looking at their aggregates) in order to provide the required 15,000 SAPS. 
From the storage perspective, to accommodate the requirements of 10,000 IOPS and 2 TB for database files, the solution includes 2 x P30 disks, with 1TB and 5,000 IOPS per disk. For logs, a single P20 disks, providing 0.5 TB in size and 2,500 IOPS will suffice. 

![Nine sizing for Azure columns include items such as Azure VM type, number of vms and whether they are active, SAPS provided, Database Files Premium Storage SKU and number of disks, IOPS for Database Files provided, Storage size allocated for DB files, Database Log Premium Storage SKU and number of disks, and Latency for Log. Unlike the previous table, solution information displays for some sizing for Azure cells.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image23.png)

**Task:** Identifying the target Azure region(s) and the number of tiers:

-   Identify the optimal choices for the Azure region(s) where the solution should be deployed.

-   Choose between the 2-tier and 3-tier approach.

-   Ensure that high-availability and disaster recovery requirements are satisfied.

**Answer:** By deploying Azure VMs in two regions (with US East 2 as the primary region and US West 2 as the secondary), we are able to address the Disaster Recovery needs of the customer. Within each region, the design is based on the 3-tier architecture consisting of the presentation tier, the application tier, and the database tier. In the two-tier architecture, the application and database tiers are combined together, running on the same operating system instance. Each tier contains two or more VMs in the same availability set to provide 99.95% availability SLA. It is worth noting that the choice of the disaster recovery site is not based on the region pairing (the East US 2 region is paired up with the Central US region) but rather takes into account the availability of Azure VM sizes that can be used to host SAP workloads (in particular, Mv2 and GS series VMs). 

*Preferred solution cost*

Cost estimate assumptions

![A list of cost estimate assumptions details both included and not included cost estimate assumptions.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SAPonAzureimages/media/image10.png)

Azure VM pricing tips

-   VM uptime is the critical component of compute cost. 

-   Consider using Reserved Instances for VMs that need to be online 24 x 7

-   When using Windows Server VMs, take advantage of the Azure Hybrid Use Benefits (if applicable)

-   Make sure to account for SAP licenses, OS licenses, and Microsoft Support

-   Start with Pay-As-You-Go licensing and switch to Reserved Instances once expected system utilization is determined

*Architecting network connectivity*

**Task:** Design a hybrid network (at a high-level) that will allow you to meet all the customer requirements and support your design for moving Contoso SAP landscape to Azure:

-   Design virtual networking in Azure and suggest the hybrid connectivity configuration between Contoso on-premises environment and Azure

**Answer:** Use ExpressRoute between the corporate headquarters and two Azure regions that will host the SAP deployment. For development or training scenarios, it might be sufficient to use a site-to-site Virtual Private Network (VPN). You can use the online Azure Speed Test to determine the latency you should expect when establishing a site-to-site VPN connection. However, Site-to-Site VPN connections are, at best, limited to 1.25 Gbps and introduce double digit millisecond latencies. For production SAP workloads hosted in Azure, you should consider using ExpressRoute. This allows for establishing a private connection to Azure, providing up to 10 Gbps of bandwidth and lowering latency to a couple of milliseconds.

*Architecting (ASCS) components*

**Task:** Design a scalable and highly available solution.

**Answer:** By deploying Azure VMs in two regions, we are able to meet the resiliency needs of the customer. Scaling of the (A)SCS tier involves increasing or decreasing the size of Azure VMs. The SAP Central Services instance is protected by leveraging Window Server Failover Cluster. This ensures high availability of the messaging service and Enqueue Replication Service components. The SAP Central Service uses the Azure internal load balancer to facilitate failover capability. Windows Server 2016 Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) cluster with its Scale Out File Server (SOFS) role host the highly available sapmnt share. 

By deploying Azure VMs hosting the (A)SCS in two regions, we are able to meet the disaster recovery needs of the customer. We also schedule a task to copy the primary instance of sapmnt share to the corresponding share on the DR cluster serving the SOFS role. As part of failover, we change the IP of the global host DNS record to the IP of the SOFS. 

*Architecting application components*

**Task:** Design a scalable and highly available solution.

**Answer:** Scaling of the application tier can be accomplished by deploying additional application servers (AAS) to supplement the Primary Application Server. The HTTP(S) load balancing is handled by the SAP Web Dispatcher running on Azure VMs. The SAP Logon load balancing is handled by the SCS message server.

The application server does not contain any business data and does not need to be replicated to the DR very often. The only content that changes periodically is the SAP kernel after a kernel upgrade. Consider using ASR for replication from on-premises to Azure and between Azure regions.

*Architecting database components*

**Task:** Design a resilient and scalable SQL Server backend configured to span geographically distributed datacenters.

**Answer:** Scaling of the database tier involves increasing or decreasing the size of Azure VMs. For Microsoft SQL Server, we use AlwaysOn Availability Group (AG) built on top of the Windows Server Failover Clustering and leveraging the Cloud Witness quorum, eliminating the dependency on a shared disk or a file share. Azure internal load balancer represents the listener of the SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Group containing the SAP database.

Failover between Azure SQL VMs in the same Azure region is automatic (synchronous replication). Failover between Azure SQL VMs from the primary to the secondary Azure region is manual (since there is the possibility of data loss due to asynchronous replication).

## Checklist of preferred objection handling

1.  If I have already paid for my hardware to run my dev/test environment, how am I getting any cost savings by moving it to Azure? How much more is your cloud solution costing me?

    **Potential Answer:** A Global audit, tax and consulting company reduced TCO by 40-75% by hosting SAP systems on Azure and turning off unused resources. A global snack food company reduced TCO by 40-75% by moving 126 legacy SAP systems on Azure; A medical supply company reduced TCO by 50% by moving SAP training environment to Azure. Use the TCO tool (http://aka.ms/azuretco) to uncover all categories of potential cost savings (e.g., hardware, software, maintenance, admin, power, facility). Because of the large scale of Azure datacenters, Microsoft is able to optimize the cost efficiencies that are then passed to customers in the form of price cuts.

    Other benefits include enhanced agility and global presence.

2.  What if I need my cloud resources to access on-premises resources?

    **Potential Answer:** Microsoft supports a hybrid solution, with symmetry between on-premises applications and those on the public cloud. Azure virtual networks allow creating logically isolated environments in Azure and securely connecting them to on-premises datacenter. If customers need private, dedicated connection to Azure, they can use ExpressRoute.

3.  Will Azure meet our security and compliance requirements?

    **Potential Answer:** Microsoft policy is to be fully transparent about security and compliance policies, procedures, and certifications. Customers can access comprehensive documentation covering security and compliance in Microsoft Azure in public facing Azure Trust Center.

4.  Do I have to pay for resources when they are stopped?

    **Potential Answer:** Yes, the VM must be deallocated before the charges cease. If the VM is stopped it will continue to incur charges. Deallocating does not mean deleting the VM as it still exists in storage. You will still incur storage charge even if the VM is deallocated.

5.  Can I automate the shutdown at periodic times of day?

    **Potential Answer:** Yes, this functionality is available directly from the Azure platform without the need for a custom solution. In addition, the customer can use Azure Automation runbooks or custom Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI scripts to start Azure VMs on as-needed basis.

## Customer quote (to be read back to the attendees at the end)

"Azure has introduced new opportunities in regard to quickly provisioning development and user acceptance testing environments for our various SAP workloads. It also provided high availability and disaster recovery capabilities for our production environment at a very reasonable price."
